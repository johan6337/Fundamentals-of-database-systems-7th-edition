# Question 2.8 #

With what other computer system software does a DBMS interact?

# Answer #

The types of computer system software that interact with a DBMS include Operating Systems, Data Query Languages, Transaction Monitors, Application Software, and Backup & Recovery Software.

- **Operating Systems**: The DBMS interacts with the operating system to read and write data files, to access the file system, and to manage the hardware resources of the computer system. The operating system provides the basic services that the DBMS needs to function, such as process management, memory management, and I/O management.

- **Data Query Languages**: The DBMS interacts with data query languages to process user queries and commands. The most common data query language is SQL (Structured Query Language), which is used to retrieve, update, insert, and delete data in a database.

- **Transaction Monitors**: The DBMS interacts with transaction monitors to manage concurrent access to the database by multiple users. Transaction monitors ensure that transactions are executed in a consistent and reliable manner, even in the presence of failures or system crashes.

- **Application Software**: The DBMS interacts with application software to provide data storage and retrieval services to applications. Application software can be custom-built or off-the-shelf software that uses the DBMS to store and retrieve data.

- **Backup & Recovery Software**: The DBMS interacts with backup and recovery software to create backups of the database and to recover the database in case of data loss or corruption. Backup and recovery software ensures that the data in the database is protected and can be restored in case of disasters or failures.
