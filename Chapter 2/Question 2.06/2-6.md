# Question 2.6 #

What is the difference between procedural and nonprocedural DMLs?

# Answer #

There are two main types of DMLs. A high-level or nonprocedural DML can be
used on its own to specify complex database operations concisely. Many DBMSs
allow high-level DML statements either to be entered interactively from a display
monitor or terminal or to be embedded in a general-purpose programming language. In the latter case, DML statements must be identified within the program so 
that they can be extracted by a precompiler and processed by the DBMS. A lowlevel or procedural DML must be embedded in a general-purpose programming
language. This type of DML typically retrieves individual records or objects from
the database and processes each separately. Therefore, it needs to use programming
language constructs, such as looping, to retrieve and process each record from a set
of records. Low-level DMLs are also called record-at-a-time DMLs because of this
property. High-level DMLs, such as SQL, can specify and retrieve many records in
a single DML statement; therefore, they are called set-at-a-time or set-oriented
DMLs. A query in a high-level DML often specifies which data to retrieve rather
than how to retrieve it; therefore, such languages are also called declarative
