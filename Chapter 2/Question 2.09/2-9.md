# Question 2.9 #

What is the difference between the two-tier and three-tier client/server
architectures?

# Answer #

- The two-tier client/server architecture consists of two layers:

1. **Client Layer**: The client layer is responsible for presenting the user interface and processing user requests. It interacts directly with the database server to retrieve and update data.

2. **Server Layer**: The server layer is responsible for managing the database and processing the data requests from the client. It interacts directly with the database to execute queries and transactions.

- The three-tier client/server architecture consists of three layers:

1. **Client Layer**: The client layer is responsible for presenting the user interface and processing user requests. It interacts with the middle-tier server to send and receive data.

2. **Middle-Tier Server**: The middle-tier server is responsible for processing the data requests from the client and interacting with the database server to retrieve and update data. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the database server.

3. **Database Server**: The database server is responsible for managing the database and processing the data requests from the middle-tier server. It interacts directly with the database to execute queries and transactions.

The main difference between the two-tier and three-tier client/server architectures is the presence of an additional middle-tier server in the three-tier architecture. The middle-tier server acts as an intermediary between the client and the database server, providing additional processing and security capabilities. This separation of concerns in the three-tier architecture allows for better scalability, flexibility, and security compared to the two-tier architecture.
