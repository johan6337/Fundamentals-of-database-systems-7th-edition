# Question 2.13 #

Choose a database application with which you are familiar. Design a schema
and show a sample database for that application, using the notation of Figures 1.2 and 2.1. What types of additional information and constraints
would you like to represent in the schema? Think of several users of your
database, and design a view for each

# Answer #

- This is an open question. Just choose any database application you are familiar with and design a schema for it. I am lazy so i will skip this question. It easy.
