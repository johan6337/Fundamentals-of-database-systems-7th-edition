# Question 2.14 #

If you were designing a Web-based system to make airline reservations and sell
airline tickets, which DBMS architecture would you choose from Section 2.5?
Why? Why would the other architectures not be a good choice?

# Answer #

- The best architecture for web-based system is three-tier architecture: The web user interface is placed in the client system,
The database server contains the DBMS
Web/application server will handle the application logic of the system
Web server can handle those transactions validate the data and manipulate database accordingly.
The web user interface is vital as different types of users e.g. naive users interact with the system

- Other architectures are not appropriate cuz: 

- For basic client-server architecture, the DBMSs and the user interface are on the same machine. This is not suitable for web-based systems as the user interface is on the client system and the DBMS is on the server.

- For two-tier architecture, cuz it dont have the middle layer to handle the application logic maybe can cause bottleneck in the system.
