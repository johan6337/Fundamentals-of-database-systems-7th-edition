# Question 2.4 #

Describe the three-schema architecture. Why do we need mappings among
schema levels? How do different schema definition languages support this
architecture?

# Answer #

- **Three-schema architecture**: The three-schema architecture is a framework for database systems that separates the user view, the logical view, and the physical view of the database. The three levels are:

  - **External schema (User view)**: The external schema is the view of the database as seen by the application programs. It describes the part of the database that is relevant to the specific user or application. Each user may have a different external schema tailored to their needs.

  - **Conceptual schema (Logical view)**: The conceptual schema represents the entire database in terms of a high-level description. It describes what data is stored in the database and the relationships among the data. It is independent of the physical storage details and is used to provide a global view of the database.

  - **Internal schema (Physical view)**: The internal schema describes the physical storage of the database. It includes details such as data structures, file organization, indexing methods, and access paths. It is concerned with how the data is stored on the storage devices.

- **Need for mappings among schema levels**: Mappings are needed to translate data and queries between different schema levels. These mappings ensure that changes made at one level do not affect the other levels and provide a layer of abstraction between the different views of the database. They also allow for data independence, where changes in the physical storage do not affect the external and conceptual schemas.

- **Schema definition languages**: Different schema definition languages support the three-schema architecture by providing tools to define and manage the schemas at each level. Some common schema definition languages include:

  - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: DDL is used to define the schema at the conceptual and internal levels. It allows users to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.

  - **Data Description Language (DDL)**: DDL is used to define the external schema. It allows users to specify the data elements and relationships that are relevant to their applications.

  - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: DML is used to query and manipulate data at the external schema level. It provides commands to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from the database.

  - **Query Languages**: Query languages such as SQL are used to access and manipulate data at the external schema level. They provide a way to interact with the database and retrieve information based on user requirements.
