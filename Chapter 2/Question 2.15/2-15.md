# Question 2.15 #

Consider Figure 2.1. In addition to constraints relating the values of columns in one table to columns in another table, there are also constraints that
impose restrictions on values in a column or a combination of columns
within a table. One such constraint dictates that a column or a group of columns must be unique across all rows in the table. For example, in the
STUDENT table, the Student_number column must be unique (to prevent two
different students from having the same Student_number). Identify the column or the group of columns in the other tables that must be unique across
all rows in the table.
