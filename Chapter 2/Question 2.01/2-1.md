# Question 2.1 #

internal schema, conceptual schema, external schema, data independence,
DDL, DML, SDL, VDL, query language, host language, data sublanguage,
database utility, catalog, client/server architecture, three-tier architecture,
and n-tier architecture.

# Answer #

- **Data Model**: A data model is a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database. It provides the necessary means to achieve a better understanding of the data and to communicate knowledge about the structure of the database to others. A data model is a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database. It provides the necessary means to achieve a better understanding of the data and to communicate knowledge about the structure of the database to others.

- **Database Schema**: A database schema is the structure that represents the logical view of the entire database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It is a blueprint of the database that outlines the tables, columns, relationships, views, indexes, and other elements that make up the database.

- **Database State**: The database state is the current snapshot of the database at a given point in time. It represents the actual data stored in the database at that moment.

- **Internal Schema**: The internal schema is the representation of the database from the perspective of the physical storage and access methods used to store and retrieve data. It defines how the data is stored on the storage devices and how it is accessed by the database management system.

- **Conceptual Schema**: The conceptual schema is the representation of the database from the perspective of the logical structure and organization of the data. It defines the high-level view of the database, including the entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints that make up the database.

- **External Schema**: The external schema is the representation of the database from the perspective of the individual users or applications that interact with the database. It defines the specific views of the database that are tailored to the needs of different users or applications.

- **Data Independence**: Data independence is the ability to change the database schema at one level without affecting the schema at other levels. It allows changes to be made to the database structure without requiring changes to the applications that use the database.

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: When there are no separation constraints, the DDL is used to define both conceptual and internal schemas. 

- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Once the database schemas are compiled and the database is populated with data,
users must have some means to manipulate the database. Typical manipulations
include retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification of the data

- **SDL (Storage Definition Language)**: The SDL is used to specify the internal schema. It specifies the mapping between the conceptual and internal schemas.

- **VDL (View Definition Language)**: The VDL is used to define external schemas. It specifies the mapping between the conceptual schema and the external schemas.

- **Query Language**: A query language is a language used to interact with a database to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data. It allows users to perform operations on the database and retrieve information based on specific criteria. Ex: SQL

- **Host Language**: A host language is a programming language that is used to embed database queries and commands within the code of an application. It allows the application to interact with the database and perform operations on the data. Ex: Java, C++, Python

- **Data Sublanguage**: A data sublanguage is a subset of a query language that is used to interact with a database. It provides a set of commands and operations that can be used to manipulate the data in the database.

- **Database Utility**: A database utility is a software tool that is used to perform administrative tasks on a database. It includes functions such as backup, restore, import, export, and monitoring of the database.

- **Catalog**: A catalog is a collection of metadata that describes the structure and organization of the database. It includes information about the tables, columns, indexes, views, constraints, and other elements that make up the database.

- **Client/Server Architecture**: A client/server architecture is a network architecture in which clients request services from a server over a network. The server provides the requested services to the clients, which can be applications, devices, or users.

- **Three-Tier Architecture**: A three-tier architecture is a software architecture that divides an application into three layers: presentation, business logic, and data storage. Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the application, and they communicate with each other to provide the desired functionality.

- **N-Tier Architecture**: An n-tier architecture is a software architecture that divides an application into multiple layers or tiers, with each layer responsible for a specific aspect of the application. It allows for better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the application.
