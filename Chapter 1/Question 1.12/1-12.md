# Question 1.12 #

Cite some examples of integrity constraints that you think can apply to the
database shown in Figure 1.2.

# Answer #

- 

Here are some examples of **integrity constraints** that could apply to the database in Figure 1.2:

### 1. **Key Constraints**
   - **Primary Key for STUDENT Table:** The `Student_number` field must be unique for each student.
   - **Primary Key for COURSE Table:** The `Course_number` field must be unique for each course.
   - **Primary Key for SECTION Table:** The `Section_identifier` field must be unique for each section.
   - **Composite Primary Key for GRADE_REPORT Table:** A combination of `Student_number` and `Section_identifier` must be unique to avoid duplicate grade entries.
   - **Primary Key for PREREQUISITE Table:** A combination of `Course_number` and `Prerequisite_number` must be unique.

### 2. **Foreign Key Constraints**
   - **GRADE_REPORT Table:**
     - `Student_number` must refer to a valid `Student_number` in the STUDENT table.
     - `Section_identifier` must refer to a valid `Section_identifier` in the SECTION table.
   - **SECTION Table:**
     - `Course_number` must refer to a valid `Course_number` in the COURSE table.
   - **PREREQUISITE Table:**
     - `Course_number` and `Prerequisite_number` must refer to valid entries in the COURSE table.

### 3. **Domain Constraints**
   - The `Class` field in the STUDENT table should only allow valid class levels (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).
   - The `Major` field in the STUDENT table must be restricted to valid department codes (e.g., "CS," "MATH").
   - The `Credit_hours` field in the COURSE table must only allow non-negative integer values.
   - The `Grade` field in the GRADE_REPORT table must be restricted to valid grades (e.g., "A," "B," "C," etc.).

### 4. **Referential Integrity**
   - If a `Student_number` in the STUDENT table is deleted, the corresponding rows in the GRADE_REPORT table should also be removed (or updated depending on the business rule).
   - If a `Course_number` in the COURSE table is deleted, related rows in the PREREQUISITE table or SECTION table should be updated or removed accordingly.

### 5. **Null Constraints**
   - Fields like `Student_name`, `Course_name`, `Section_identifier`, and `Grade` should not allow null values.
   - Fields that serve as primary or foreign keys (e.g., `Student_number`, `Course_number`, `Section_identifier`) must also not allow null values.

### 6. **Unique Constraints**
   - The `Course_name` in the COURSE table should be unique to avoid duplicate course names.
