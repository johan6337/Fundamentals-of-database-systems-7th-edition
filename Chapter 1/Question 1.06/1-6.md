# Question 1.6 #

Discuss the capabilities that should be provided by a DBMS

# Answer #

- **Data storage, retrieval, and update**: A DBMS should provide efficient mechanisms for storing, retrieving, and updating data. The DBMS should be able to store large amounts of data and provide fast access to the data.

- **Data definition**: A DBMS should provide a language for defining the structure of the data stored in the database. This language should allow the user to specify the data types, structures, and constraints of the data.

- **Data manipulation**: A DBMS should provide a language for manipulating the data stored in the database. This language should allow the user to query the database to retrieve specific data, update the database to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generate reports from the data.

- **Data integrity**: A DBMS should provide mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of the data stored in the database. This includes enforcing constraints on the data, such as ensuring that a primary key is unique, and providing mechanisms for recovering from hardware failures.

- **Data independence**: A DBMS should provide mechanisms for separating the data from the programs that access it. This allows the data to be accessed by multiple programs and users without requiring changes to the programs.

- **Concurrency control**: A DBMS should provide mechanisms for ensuring that multiple users can access the data simultaneously without interfering with each other. This includes mechanisms for locking data items to prevent conflicts between users.

- **Security**: A DBMS should provide mechanisms for ensuring the security of the data stored in the database. This includes mechanisms for controlling access to the data, such as user authentication and authorization.

- **Backup and recovery**: A DBMS should provide mechanisms for backing up the data stored in the database and recovering from hardware failures. This includes mechanisms for creating backups of the data and restoring the data from backups in the event of a failure.
