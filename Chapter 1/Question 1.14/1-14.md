# Question 1.14 # 

1.14. Consider Figure 1.2.
- a. If the name of the ‘CS’ (Computer Science) Department changes to ‘CSSE’
(Computer Science and Software Engineering) Department and the corresponding prefix for the course number also changes, identify the columns in the database that would need to be updated.
- b. Can you restructure the columns in the COURSE, SECTION, and
PREREQUISITE tables so that only one column will need to be updated?

# Answer #

- **a.** The columns in the database that would need to be updated are:

- `Course_number` and `department` in the COURSE table.
- `Course_number` in the SECTION table.
- `Course_number` and  `Prerequisite_number` in the PREREQUISITE table.

-**b.**: We can create the new table `DEPARTMENT` with the columns `Department_id` and `Department_name`. We can then add the `Department_id` column to the COURSE, SECTION, and PREREQUISITE tables. This way, only the `Department_id` column will need to be updated.
