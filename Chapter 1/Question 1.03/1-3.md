Discuss the main characteristics of the database approach and how it differs
from traditional file systems

# Answer #

. The main characteristics of the database approach versus the
file-processing approach are the following:

- **Self-describing nature of a database system**: A DBMS catalog stores the description of the data, the structure of the data, and the structure of the database itself. This metadata is used by the DBMS software to access the data. In contrast, a traditional file system contains data but has no metadata to describe what the data means. The data in a file system is dependent on the programs used to access it.

- **Insulation between programs and data**: In a database system, the data is stored separately from the programs that operate on it. This separation allows the data to be accessed by multiple programs and users. In contrast, in a file system, the data is closely tied to the programs that access it. If the structure of the data changes, all programs that access the data must be modified.

- **Support of multiple views of the data**: A database system allows multiple views of the data to be defined and used. Each user may see a different view of the data, depending on their needs. In contrast, a file system provides only one view of the data.

- **Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing**: A database system allows multiple users to access the data simultaneously. The DBMS ensures that the data remains consistent and that transactions are processed correctly. In contrast, a file system does not provide any mechanisms for sharing data or ensuring consistency.
