# Question 1.5 #

What are the different types of database end users? Discuss the main activities of each

# Answer #

There are four types of database end users: casual end users, naive users, sophisticated users, and standalone users.

- **Casual end users** occasionally access the database, but they may need different information each time. They use a sophisticated database query interface16 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users
to specify their requests and are typically middle- or high-level managers or
other occasional browsers.

- **Naive or parametric end users** make up a sizable portion of database
end users. Their main job function revolves around constantly querying
and updating the database, using standard types of queries and updates—
called canned transactions—that have been carefully programmed and
tested. Many of these tasks are now available as mobile apps for use with
mobile devices. The tasks that such users perform are varied.

- **Sophisticated end users** include engineers, scientists, business analysts, and
others who thoroughly familiarize themselves with the facilities of the DBMS
in order to implement their own applications to meet their complex requirements.

- **Standalone users** maintain personal databases by using ready-made program packages that provide easy-to-use menu-based or graphics-based
interfaces. An example is the user of a financial software package that stores
a variety of personal financial data.
