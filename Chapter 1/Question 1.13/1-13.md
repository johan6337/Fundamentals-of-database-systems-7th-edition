# Question 1.13 #

Give examples of systems in which it may make sense to use traditional file
processing instead of a database approach

# Answer #

- An example of a system where it may make sense to use traditional file processing instead of a database approach is a system that requires a small amount of data to be stored and accessed infrequently. It not require the security, concurrency control, recovery, and integrity functions. Using traditional file processing in this case would be more cost-effective and simpler to implement than using a database approach.
